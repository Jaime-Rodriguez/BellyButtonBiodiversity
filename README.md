# Belly Button Biodiversity

The belly button is one of the habitats closest to us, and yet it remains relatively unexplored. This project provides a visual dashboard that shows the types of microbes that you would find within your belly button. You can even see how these numbers rise based on the frequency the person bathes (yikes!).
